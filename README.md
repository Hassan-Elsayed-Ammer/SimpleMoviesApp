## About 

-The application is a simple tool for browsing movies with search functionality


1. Listing:the movies are rendered in lists (grid) filtered by genre into 
tabs     
         

        . All is an extra tab in the beginning where no filtering is applied
        . The user can select any tab or swipe to the adjacent tabs
        . On Selecting each tab the movies list is loaded and filtered using the  corresponding genre
        . Show the image, name & year of production for each movies item
        . As the user scrolls down the next page is loaded until they reach the end. I.e. Implement infinite scrolling
